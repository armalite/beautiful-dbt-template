# Model Example
This DBT Model simply unions two hardcoded rows together to output a table. 
More information regarding the model is captured in the `schema.yml` file in this directory. 

## Metadata 

### Basic Metadata
The `schema.yml` file is a metadata file containing information about the model, such as a description for the table and all of its columns. You can have as many `schema.yml` files (and name them differently) as you wish. It is recommended to have one per model folder for tidiness.
